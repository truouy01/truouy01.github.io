             <h1>About Luther</h1>
             <h2>A Place of Welcome</h2>

<p> Luther values its heritage—it was founded in 1861 by Norwegian immigrants—just as it values the diversity of its students, staff, and faculty, who hail from many different faith backgrounds and heritages.

The college strives to make Luther affordable for all students by offering scholarships, need-based aid, work study, and loan programs.</p>

<h2>Academic Excellence</h2>

<p>Luther offers more than 60 majors and preprofessional programs leading to the bachelor of arts degree. The college’s learning philosophy highlights connections between disciplines, and its thoughtful and rigorous curriculum moves beyond immediate interests toward engagement in the larger world. This conscientious approach to education helps Luther earn inclusion in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges in the U.S. News and World Report’s college guide.

Luther is a Phi Beta Kappa institution, an honor belonging to only 10 percent of colleges and universities, and its graduates regularly earn prestigious awards, such as Fulbright, Rhodes, Goldwater, and NCAA Postgraduate scholarships.</p>

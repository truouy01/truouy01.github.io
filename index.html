             <h2>A Place of Welcome</h2>

<p> Luther values its heritage—it was founded in 1861 by Norwegian immigrants—just as it values the diversity of its students, staff, and faculty, who hail from many different faith backgrounds and heritages.

The college strives to make Luther affordable for all students by offering scholarships, need-based aid, work study, and loan programs.</p>

<h2>Academic Excellence</h2>

<p>Luther offers more than 60 majors and preprofessional programs leading to the bachelor of arts degree. The college’s learning philosophy highlights connections between disciplines, and its thoughtful and rigorous curriculum moves beyond immediate interests toward engagement in the larger world. This conscientious approach to education helps Luther earn inclusion in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges in the U.S. News and World Report’s college guide.

Luther is a Phi Beta Kappa institution, an honor belonging to only 10 percent of colleges and universities, and its graduates regularly earn prestigious awards, such as Fulbright, Rhodes, Goldwater, and NCAA Postgraduate scholarships.</p>
             <h2> Learning beyond the Classroom</h2>
             <p> Luther’s highly qualified faculty—93 percent of whom hold a terminal degree—and a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1 give students an exceptional classroom education, but the college also values learning beyond the classroom walls.</p>
             <p> This experiential learning contributes to the stellar career outcomes and postsecondary education rates of Luther graduates.

Study-away experiences are another way that students learn beyond the classroom, and they’re key to the global perspective that Luther promotes. Each year more than 400 Luther students study abroad in 41 countries. Many undergraduates take advantage of study-away opportunities during January Term, a three-week period between semesters that allows students to study a particular subject in depth.</p>

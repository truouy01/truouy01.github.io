              Luther College is a private liberal arts college, founded in 1861 by Norwegian immigrants in the Lutheran tradition of higher education. Our campus is located in beautiful Decorah, Iowa.

At Luther, we appreciate that you are a whole person with a variety of interests and talents. We encourage you to explore your passions, discover how your skills can meet the world's needs, and connect with the larger world through research, experiential learning, and study abroad programs.

We would love to have you visit our campus during a scheduled group visit event or on a day that works for your schedule. We look forward to meeting you!

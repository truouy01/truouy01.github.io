         <p> With more than 60 majors, minors, and preprofessional programs, Luther’s academic program is extensive and flexible enough to address the individuality of its students. Many Luther students build a double major or major-minor that speaks to their unique interests, and the Luther curriculum still allows enough room for them to try new things and take classes outside of their chosen fields of study. This is because Luther strives to develop whole minds and well-rounded intellects in the true liberal arts tradition.</p>
         <p>The liberal arts model encourages a broad, wide-ranging education, but Luther also encourages depth of learning. Our January Term, a three-week period between the fall and spring semesters, offers students a chance to explore a particular subject in depth, either in research collaboration with faculty on campus or through one of our many study-away programs. And Luther has a long tradition of augmenting classroom education with real-world learning, through internships, externships, student teaching, nursing clinicals, and other field and research experience.</p>

Luther is a Phi Beta Kappa institution, an honor belonging to only 10 percent of colleges and universities nationwide. The college’s dedicated, top-notch faculty—93 percent of whom hold a terminal degree—and a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1 mean that students receive individual attention and that professors get to know their students and become genuinely invested in their success.

Students demonstrating intellectual talent may apply to over a dozen field-specific honor societies and also to Luther’s scholars program.</p>
